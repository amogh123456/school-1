A lot of study-time together, joint efforts for the models and memorising the text to be spoken, all thsi led to our fantastic performance on the final day of science exhbition. Our topic was Insectivorous plants. I was showing Pitcher plant, Reyansh was showing Venus fly-trap, and Aman showed the Sun-dew. It was a fabulous experience working for the project.
